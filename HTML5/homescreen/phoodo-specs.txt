AtomusGames App Jam Specifications - 7/15/2017

I'm calling it "phoodo", but you can call it whatever you want.  The client will probably want to rename it anyway.

1) easily take photos of meals
2) filter and recall photos on demand

Any

This is a paid job, but I don't know yet how much.  Whatever we decide to charge will be split 4 ways.  Each competitor gets 1 share.  The client will pick a favorite submission and the winner will receive the 4th share.  Example: if Dmitry wins and we charge $400 split 4 ways = $100 to Jona, Dmitry and Rick, but Dmitry would get an extra $100 for a total of $200.
